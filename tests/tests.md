For unit and integration tests, encouraging TDD/BDD practices.
##TDD: Test-Driven Development  
1. Write a failing test
2. Write code to make the test pass
3. Refactor the code
This ensures your code is always tested and helps catch bugs early.

##BDD: Behavior-Driven Development  
An extension of TDD that focuses on the behavior of an application from the end user's perspective. Tests are written in a more natural, descriptive language (often using tools like Cucumber or Jasmine), making them easier to understand for non-developers.
BDD encourages collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders.

Simply, 

TDD: Write tests first, then code. Focus on correctness.
BDD: Write tests in plain language, focus on behavior and collaboration.
